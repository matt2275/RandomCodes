All files are assumed to be in the Histogram and Plot Directory Specified in Config File
In lxplus example typically the input data and output plots are in eos while the macros are in afs

#### Selection.txt #####
selections to be applied to data

###Format

Selection: PT_Cut && !BadEta_Cut

#### CutType.txt ####
It is best practice to include _CUT at the end of the cut selections incase you're cut name is including in the cut
selection i.e. tag_isMuon: tag_isMuon. This could cause errors in the selection. 

Included is a universal cut that is applied to all selections in file
This cannot be empty so for a null statment you can use always true statement like 1==1

### Format

CutName_Cut: pt > 2 && abs(eta) < 2.4

#### list_selections.txt ####

list of selections to be applied to data
you'll probably want to split into multiple sets to prevent memory issues

#### list_datatypes.txt ####

list of data types to be analyzed usually MC types and Data
with create histogram macro you'll probably want to split into multiple sets to prevent memory issues

#### config.txt ####

Format

#1 Input Data Location
#2 Histogram and Plot Location
#3 File Type Either 1 Prong or 3 Prong
#4 1D_HistParams_CustomBins.csv
#5 2D_HistParams_CustomBins.csv

#7 Selections.txt
#8 Plot Name Beginning 
#9 Denominator in Efficiency Studies
#10 Denominator of Scale Factors
#11 Normalizatino XS or Unity
#12 Folder Plots go into, only active for certain macros Right Now
#13 DataSamplesInfo_PlotAnything.csv # at the moment only Plot Anything and Profile Plot require this input, others assume the name DataSamplesInfo.csv

#### DataSampleInfo.csv ####

csv with information for plotting data and MC, included file name, color and marker style, cross section info and legend name 

Profile Plot and Plot Anything Macros require a different DataSampleInfo with selection information as well

#### 1D_HistParams_CustomBins.csv ####

info for 1D histogram header row explains entries

#### 2D_HistParams_CustomBins.csv ####

info for 2D histogram header row explains entries
